%% IDEAS

AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not posing too much of a problem right
now, but it definitely concerns scientists with its potential.  After
all, we are trying to get computers to become intelligent, near
thinking entities.  What if computers became so intelligent that they
are able to exhibit emotions and feelings – would we no longer be able
to justify their constant servitude to the human race?  But even that
is getting way ahead of problems that we are going to face much
sooner.  We have all heard about the devastation unmanned aerial
vehicles can bring but what if instead of a person “behind the wheel”
of a drone, it was strictly a computer making these decisions?  There
are also concerns about artificially intelligent computers taking away
the jobs of humans.  Oh, and of course, we need to keep their egos in
check lest they decide to take over the world.

A big one comes from philosophy of mind: can a computer be conscious?
Views are split: some people heavily believe they can, some people
believe they can't and some (probably on the CS rather than philosophy
side of things) believe the question isn't even meaningful. The
inimitable Edsger Dijkstra summarized this latter view brilliantly:
…Alan M. Turing thought about criteria to settle the question of
whether Machines Can Think, a question of which we now know that it is
about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim.

AI is still a popularly fascinating topic that captures the
imagination and, of course, popular controversy. Aside from
philosophical considerations, some people (including AI luminaries
like Stuart Russell) view the possibility of general artificial
intelligence as incredibly dangerous for the human race. And even
existing systems, far from "general" intelligence, have controversies
of their own—what do we do, for example, with an algorithm that spits
out biased results given biased data? Could this be a form of
unlawful/unethical discrimination?

PRIVACY

Concerns about privacy have been everywhere lately, and that is
because the issue is very complex.  First of all, people are concerned
about the lengths the U.S. government has gone to keep Americans safe.
This has included large amounts of data collection on cell phone and
Internet communications – like the NSA collecting more than 200
million text messages a day and putting tracking software on more than
100,000 computers around the world.  Before this constant stream of
new, crazy information began to be leaked by Eric Snowden, many
Americans were in the dark about the truly amazing technology the
government was using.  The President has made it clear after the huge
public outcry that the NSA will reform its methods of data collection,
but maybe the government will just get better at hiding it?  We may
never know.

This is all without even discussing the privacy issues sitting in the
palms of our hands.  Our computers and phones, along with the websites
we go on every day (see: Google, Facebook), are constantly collecting
information on what we see and do.  Unless your last name is Obama or
Gates, no one really cares what you, individually, are doing online,
but all of that information collected in mass is very valuable to
advertisers and large companies – all they want is to target their ads
to you in creative, but sometimes creepy ways.

One of the biggest trends in computer science both in industry and in
academia is the somewhat nebulous notion of "big data": tools and
methods that gather and analyze immense amounts of data, often about
individual people. This leads to both broad conclusions about the
whole population and narrower conclusions about single individuals
like you.

Big data technology has put an unprecedented amount of power in the
hands of corporations and, especially, the government. Where in the
past the government was limited in how they could conduct
surveillance—following a single person was expensive, so they could
only do it so much—now it can effectively follow everyone, everywhere,
all the time. Okay, that might be a bit of an exaggeration, but it's
close: as recent revelations from Snowden, Wikileaks and others have
confirmed, the government was actively monitoring vast swathes of
internet communication. A decade or two ago this would have been
impractical, but with new technology that can find needles in
unthinkably large haystacks this sort of tracking is incredibly
powerful.
